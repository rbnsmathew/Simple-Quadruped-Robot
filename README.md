## Installing Circuitpython and Mu

The code is written on CircuitPython, which is a stripped down version of Python, made for low power microcontroller boards.
The steps to install CircuitPython on RP2040 boards, such as Raspberry Pi Pico can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-circuitpython).
The editor I used is called Mu, it is a pretty lightweight, simple enough editor that works with microcontrollers. It can be installed from [here](https://codewith.mu/).

## Transferring Files to Pi Pico
Plug in the Pi Pico after installing Circuitpython, you will get access to a drive on the Pi Pico. Open the lib folder and paste these files and folders:

1. adafruit_bus_device
2. adafruit_register
3. adafruit_pca9685.mpy
4. CustomLib.py

The first three are from the libraries of CircuitPython. The ones on this repository works fine but your free to download the latest version of the CircuitPython and the updated libraries from their [official site](https://circuitpython.org/).

Now paste the code.py file into the root of the drive. Do not rename the files.

The CustomLib.py file contains a list of parameters that can characterise the movement, like step time, length of strides, max height leg should rise and such.

The code.py file contains a line of code that waits for and Enter key press from user on REPL console. This was done to prevent the robot just starting everytime it's plugged in.
You can disable it by just deleting that line. There will be a delay of 2s after code starts before the robot starts moving. This can also be edited as per need.

## CAD Models

I have also uploaded the CAD files for the robot, the same is also uploaded in the [hackster site](https://www.hackster.io/rbnsmathew/simple-quadruped-robot-ebe1fd) for the project.
